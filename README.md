# XML Validator

This application provides a front-end wrapper around the .NET XML Schema validation library to validate a set of XML files against a set of XSD files. Files must have the extension of .xml and .xsd. The application also saves settings last used settings in a XmlValidator.ini file, although the application needs write permissions to the current directory.
